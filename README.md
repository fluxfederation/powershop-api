We have closed off all versions of the public API (since 2016)

Future API _may_ be reopened to the public in the future but there are no firm plans at this stage. This README below is for reference purposes only.

Welcome to Powershop's API
=============

Getting up and running with our API is easy, but there are a few steps involved before you can get started:

1. You'll first need to register an API key with us. We aren't offering them at the moment but may consider doing it again in the future.
2. Next you'll need to know some basics around OAuth 1.0a and how it works, so get your google on if you don't already know.
3. And finally, checkout our [terms and conditions](https://github.com/powershop/powershop-api/blob/master/doc/API%20terms%20and%20conditions.pdf) before you get started, so you know what we're about and why you'd want to connect to our API.

We've split this guide up into three parts:

* [Kicking the tyres](https://github.com/powershop/powershop-api/wiki/Configuration-&-Setup) - Configuration and Setup
* [Just Cruising](https://github.com/powershop/powershop-api/wiki/API-Documentation) - All the API documentation
* Autobahn - Here be Germans
