## Welcome to Powershop's API

![Powered by Powershop](http://www.powershop.co.nz/content/developers-api/images/badge-powered-by-powershop.png)

Getting up and running with our API is easy, but there are a few steps involved before you can get started:

1. You'll first need to register an API key with us, just email us at: [developers@powershop.co.nz](mailto:devs@powershop.co.nz)
2. Next you'll need to know some basics around OAuth 1.0a and how it works, so get your google on if you don't already know.
3. And finally, checkout our [terms and conditions](https://github.com/powershop/powershop-api/blob/master/doc/API%20terms%20and%20conditions.pdf) before you get started, so you know what we're about and why you'd want to connect to our API.

We've split this guide up into three parts:

* [Kicking the tyres](https://github.com/powershop/powershop-api/wiki/Configuration-&-Setup) - Configuration and Setup
* [Just Cruising](https://github.com/powershop/powershop-api/wiki/API-Documentation) - All the API documentation
* Autobahn - Here be Germans
